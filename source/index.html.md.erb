# GOV.UK Tariff API

GOV.UK Tariff API makes it easy to access trade tariff data
on [https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).
The data includes commodity codes, duty and VAT rates.

GOV.UK Tariff API is accessed via [HTTP][] and returns data in a [JSON][]
format. The [reference documentation](reference.html) provides a thorough
overview of the endpoints and the response format.

## What you can do with this API

The data provided by this API is used on GOV.UK [Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).

With the GOV.UK Tariff API, you can access Commodity codes, which [classify 
goods](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports)
for import and export. Commodity codes allow you to:

- fill in declarations and other paperwork
- check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
- find out about duty reliefs and preferential rates
- find out if import or export licenses are needed

This API is useful for applications that incorporate content from GOV.UK [Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff) and for keeping that content up to date. It is meant to provide a predictable and stable interface to UK.GOV tariff data.

## What you can't do with this API

Not all features are implemented yet. Some features we would like to implement are:

- Search by free-form text or `goods_nomenclature_item_id`
- Scope API calls by date
- Provide resources for all headings and all commodities

## Quick start

You can use GOV.UK Tariff API to lookup the data that is used on 
[`https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff`](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).

To get started:

 1. Using a tool such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/),
    [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or your web browser, make a GET
    request to [`https://trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/v1/sections.json`](https://trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/v1/sections.json).
 2. You’ll receive a JSON response and the fields for this are
    explained in the [reference documentation](reference.html).

For example, using the curl command line utility tool:

```shell
curl https://trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/v1/sections.json
```
